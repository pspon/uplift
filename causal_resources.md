# Causal Inference Resources

Causal inference is essential for understanding true cause–and–effect relationships in data. Below is a list of key tools, packages, and learning resources:

## Key Python Packages
- **DoWhy:**  
  Provides a four–step framework (modeling, identification, estimation, and refutation) for causal analysis.  
  [Documentation & Examples](https://microsoft.github.io/dowhy/)
  
- **CausalImpact:**  
  Designed for time–series interventions using Bayesian structural time–series models.  
  [Learn more](https://google.github.io/CausalImpact/)

- **Causallib:**  
  Wraps various causal analysis methods in a Scikit–Learn–like API.  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/IBM/causallib)

- **Causalinference:**  
  Focuses on propensity score estimation and treatment effect estimation.  
  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/laurencium/causalinference)

- **Additional Tools:**  
  [econml](https://github.com/microsoft/EconML) and [causalml](https://github.com/uber/causalml) for advanced techniques such as heterogeneous treatment effects and uplift modeling.

## Learning Resources
- **Books:**  
  – *The Book of Why* by Judea Pearl  
  – *Causal Inference in Statistics: A Primer* by Pearl, Glymour, & Jewell

- **Example Notebooks:**  
  Many packages include example notebooks to practice on simulated or real–world data.
