# 13–Week Part–Time Learning Schedule

This schedule is designed for busy professionals who wish to deepen their expertise in causal inference, explainable AI (XAI), explainable clustering, and ethical AI while studying part–time (approximately 10–12 hours per week). Wherever possible, we highlight credentialed courses and projects that can boost your resume.

> **Note:** Feel free to adjust the pace or order based on your background and schedule.
